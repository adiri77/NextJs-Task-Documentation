### Project Explanation

#### Frontend

1. **MyApp Component (_app.js)**:
   - This is the main entry point for your Next.js app.
   - The `MyApp` function wraps the application with Redux using `wrapper.withRedux(MyApp)`.

2. **Home Component (index.js)**:
   - This is the main page component.
   - Styled-components are used for styling the elements.
   - `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch the initial counter value from the server during server-side rendering.
   - The component is connected to the Redux store using `connect`.

3. **Counter Actions (counterActions.js)**:
   - Contains action creators for fetching, incrementing, and decrementing the counter value.
   - Uses `axios` to make HTTP requests to the backend.

4. **Counter Reducer (counterReducer.js)**:
   - Defines the initial state and reducer function for the counter.
   - Handles the `SET_COUNTER` action to update the counter value in the Redux store.

5. **Root Reducer (index.js in reducers folder)**:
   - Combines the counter reducer with any other reducers using `combineReducers`.

6. **Store Configuration (index.js in store folder)**:
   - Configures the Redux store using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit.
   - `createWrapper` is used to integrate the store with Next.js.

#### Backend

1. **Server Setup (index.js)**:
   - Express is used to create the server.
   - Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
   - CORS is enabled, and JSON body parsing is set up.

2. **Counter Model**:
   - Defines the schema for the counter with a default value of 0.
   - Initializes the counter if it doesn't exist in the database.

3. **API Routes**:
   - `/increment`: Increments the counter value by 1.
   - `/decrement`: Decrements the counter value by 1.
   - `/value`: Fetches the current counter value.

4. **Server Start**:
   - The server starts listening on port 3000.

# Next.js Counter App with Redux and Server-side Rendering

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple counter application built with Next.js, Redux, and Express. It uses server-side rendering (SSR) to fetch the initial counter value, ensuring no client-side involvement during the initial load. The counter value is stored in MongoDB, and actions to increment or decrement the counter are performed via API calls to the backend.

## Features

- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- State management with Redux
- Styled-components for styling
- Backend API with Express and MongoDB
- Fully server-side rendered with no client-side involvement

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nextjs-redux-counter.git
   cd nextjs-redux-counter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # For frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # For backend
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     ```

4. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Run the frontend application**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure

### Frontend

- **_app.js**:
  - Wraps the app with Redux.

- **index.js**:
  - Main page component with server-side fetching of the counter value.

- **store/reducers/counterActions.js**:
  - Defines actions to fetch, increment, and decrement the counter value.

- **store/reducers/counterReducer.js**:
  - Defines the counter reducer.

- **store/reducers/index.js**:
  - Combines reducers.

- **store/index.js**:
  - Configures the Redux store.

### Backend

- **index.js**:
  - Sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and defines API routes.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /value**:
  - Fetches the current counter value from the database.

- **POST /increment**:
  - Increments the counter value by 1.

- **POST /decrement**:
  - Decrements the counter value by 1.

## How It Works

1. When the Next.js app is loaded, `getServerSideProps` in the `Home` component fetches the initial counter value from the backend.
2. The counter value is stored in the Redux store and rendered on the server.
3. When the user clicks the increment or decrement buttons, actions are dispatched to the Redux store.
4. These actions make API calls to the backend to update the counter value in the database.
5. The updated counter value is then reflected in the UI.
